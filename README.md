# Tundra Targeted Therapeutics Site

This project was a simple site mock-up for a start-up based on Figma wire frames (see below). My aim with this project was to learn and practice with Next.js and TypeScript. I used Next.js, TypeScript, Node.js, TailwindCSS, and example data read from json files using fs for coding this application.

Not compatible with all screen types.
